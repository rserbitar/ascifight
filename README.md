# **ASCI-Fight** allows you to fight with your teammates in style

A Social Coding Interaction - Fight: allows for a couple of teams to fight
against each other in a game of social coding and interaction. Outsmart your
colleagues by building the best script bots and compete in various types of
combat.

This repository consists of to parts:

- The server that is hosting the game engine and its interfaces and supplies
the game rules.
- The client that gives commands to the actors of a team. Its the objective
of a team to improve the existing logic code so that the team wins more games
than others.

## Installing

### Server Docker

#### 1. Build the server image

  ```[bash]
  podman build -t ascifight .
  ```

#### 2. Run the server container

  ```[bash]
  docker run -p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000 ascifight
  ```

#### 3. Check your browser

<http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>

Here you will find documentation about the server and its available endpoints
to steer your team to victory.
Configure the server using: server_config.toml

### Client Docker

#### 1. Build the client image

  ```[bash]
  podman build -f src/ascifight/client_lib/Dockerfile -t ascifight_client .
  ```

#### 2. Run the client container

  ```[bash]
  podman run --network="host" ascifight_client
  ```

## Client Lib

The client is located in the client_lib directory. Important files are:

- client.py: The executable that manages the basic interaction with the server
- logic.py: The file that contains the basic game logic. It uses
  - infra.py: Basic function that encapsulate interaction with the server
  - agents.py: Simple agents that encapsulate certain behavior and showcase the
  infrastructure
  - metrics.py: path-finding and distance calculations
  - basic_functions.py: basic functionality using path-finding and distance
  - state.py: a general game state class that supplies 4 classes:
    - Objects: returns all objects in the game
    - Rules: the current game rules
    - Conditions: higher level abstractions and statements about the game state
    - Actions: Actions that have been successfully performed by all teams
    during the game
- client_config.toml: A config file for the client

There is a testing client test_client.py that can be sued to test an team
against itself. Note that it does not use the team names and passwords from
the .toml file, but has hardcoded ones.
